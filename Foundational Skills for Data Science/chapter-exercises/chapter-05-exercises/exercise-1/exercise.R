# Exercise 1: practice with basic R syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born


# Assign your name to the variable `my_name`


# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`


# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have


# Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs


# Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies


# Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
# than $1,000


# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
# afford for $1,000
