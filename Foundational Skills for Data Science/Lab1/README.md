In this [article](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/pete-carroll-says-russell-wilson-is-off-to-his-best-start-ever-for-3-1-seahawks/), Pete Carroll states why Russell Wilson should be in the MVP Conversation.

> I think he's off to his best start ever. I don't know what it looks like numbers wise, but I think it is. I don't think he's ever been more accurate than he's been, and more consistent, and in command of everything. I think he's off to a great start. I don't care how big the numbers are, I'm not talking about how many yards or whatever, just his play has been really, really sharp.
