### Exercise 1: 

```{r}
128 * 42 - (145/9) + 1.7^4
```

The answer is 5368.241

### Exercise 2: 

```{r}
x <- sqrt(1127)
x
```

The square root of 1127 is 33.57

### Exercise 3: 

```{r}
statistics_is_fun <- sqrt((1+2+3+4))
statistics_is_fun
```

The square root of 1+2+3+4 is 3.16

### Exercise 4: 

```{r}
(x + statistics_is_fun)/x
```

The answer is 1.09

### Exercise 5: 

```{r}
z <- 12
y <- 17
z - y

```

I resolved the conflict by declaring the variables before the math function
