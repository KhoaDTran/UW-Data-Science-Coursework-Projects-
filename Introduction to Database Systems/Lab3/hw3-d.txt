As this is my first time using a DMBS cloud service, I struggled figuring out how to import the data and run queries. However, after messing around with the service, I was able to figure things out and I believe that the service is very helpful as it provide good marks on errors and provide useful information.
I think that offering DMBS as a public cloud service is amazing because the effectiveness of importing data from other locations and allows the user to not worry about functionality and compatibility. It is also great because it has great accesibility towards databases.
